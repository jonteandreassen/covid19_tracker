## Covid 19 Tracker Sweden

API used: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

MY idea with the project is that I wanted to learn more about javaScript, react and working with APIs.
I thought that rather then going to a dedicated website that has the same type of information I thought that I was going to build it myself.
