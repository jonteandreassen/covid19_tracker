## Covid 19 Tracker Sweden

API used: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

My idea with the project was to collect covid19 data and learn more about working with APIs and javascript. 
I thought that rather then going to a dedicated website that has the same type of information I thought that I was going to build it myself.

- The website hosted localy
- Built with javaScript (React)
- Graph tool: Recharts
